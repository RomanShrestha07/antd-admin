# Ant Design Admin

This is a small sample project of an Admin Panel created exclusively using the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) library.

The aim of this project was to create a sort of template for future projects using Ant Design.

The Admin Panel contains:

- `Login Page`: With a demo on simple token authentication login system.
- `Dashboard Page`: With demos on multiple types of Ant Design Charts.
- `Products Page`: With demos on state manipulation functionalities leading to data display, delete and search as well as data add and edit using forms.
- `Users Page`: With demos on data searching, filtering and sorting using APIs.
- `About Page`: With a demo on typography using Ant Design.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
